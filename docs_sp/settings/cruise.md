## Intelligent Cruise Button Management (ICBM)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Param** | `IntelligentCruiseButtonManagement` |
| **Type** | Toggle (On/Off) |
| **Default** | Off |

Allows sunnypilot to dynamically manage cruise speed by intercepting button presses on the steering wheel. When enabled, speed adjustments are handled intelligently to support features like Speed Limit Control.

!!! info "Requirements"
    - Vehicle must support ICBM (shown only when `intelligentCruiseButtonManagementAvailable` is true in car parameters)

!!! note "Vehicle Compatibility"
    Not all vehicles support ICBM. If this toggle does not appear, your vehicle does not support this feature.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Param** | `SmartCruiseControlVision` |
| **Type** | Toggle (On/Off) |
| **Default** | Off |

Uses vision-based data to make smarter cruise control decisions, such as adjusting speed based on detected lead vehicles.

!!! info "Requirements"
    - ICBM must be enabled
    - Vehicle must support ICBM

## Smart Cruise Control — Map (SCC-M)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Param** | `SmartCruiseControlMap` |
| **Type** | Toggle (On/Off) |
| **Default** | Off |

Uses map data (curves, speed limits) to adjust cruise speed proactively.

!!! info "Requirements"
    - ICBM must be enabled
    - Vehicle must support ICBM

## Custom ACC Increments

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Param** | `CustomAccIncrementsEnabled` |
| **Type** | Toggle (On/Off) |
| **Default** | Off |

| **Param** | `CustomAccShortPressIncrement` |
| **Type** | Option selector |
| **Range** | 1–10 |
| **Default** | 1 |

Sets the speed change (in your unit preference: km/h or mph) for a short press of the cruise speed button.

### Long Press Increment

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Param** | `CustomAccLongPressIncrement` |
| **Type** | Option selector |
| **Options** | 1 → 1, 2 → 5, 3 → 10 |
| **Default** | 1 (value: 1) |

Sets the speed change for a long press. The mapping is:

| Selection | Speed Change |

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Param** | `DynamicExperimentalControl` |
| **Type** | Toggle (On/Off) |
| **Default** | Off |

Automatically switches between openpilot and experimental mode based on driving conditions. When enabled, the system uses real-time signals (speed, turn detection, stop signs, traffic lights) to determine the most appropriate driving mode.

!!! info "Requirements"
    - Longitudinal control must be available
    - Device must be offroad to toggle
