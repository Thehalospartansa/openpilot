# Neural Network Lateral Control (NNLC)

## What It Does

NNLC replaces the traditional PID or torque-based steering controller with a neural network trained on real driving data. This can provide smoother, more natural-feeling lane keeping that adapts to your vehicle's steering characteristics.

## How It Works

Instead of using fixed mathematical formulas (PID controller), NNLC uses a machine learning model to calculate steering commands. The neural network has been trained on real-world driving data and can handle a wider variety of driving scenarios with smoother output.

## Requirements

!!! info "Requirements"
    - Vehicle must not use angle-based steering (`steerControlType` must not be `angle`)
    - Mutually exclusive with [Torque Control](torque-control.md) — only one can be active at a time
    - Device must be offroad to enable/disable

## How to Enable

**Settings** → **sunnypilot** → **Steering** → **Neural Network Lateral Control**

!!! tip
    Not all vehicles have NNLC models available. If the toggle does not appear, your vehicle may use angle-based steering which is not compatible with NNLC.

## NNLC vs. Torque Control

| Feature | NNLC | Torque Control |
|---------|------|---------------|
| **Approach** | Neural network (learned) | Mathematical formula (tuned) |
| **Customization** | Automatic | Manual tuning available |
| **Best for** | Smooth, adaptive steering | Precise, configurable steering |

These two features are mutually exclusive — enabling one automatically disables the other.

## Settings Reference

See [Steering Settings](../settings/steering.md) for configuration details.
