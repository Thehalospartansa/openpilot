# Reporting a Bug

Help us improve sunnypilot by reporting issues you encounter.

## Before Reporting

!!! warning "Remove Customizations First"
    If you have any custom modifications (forks, patches, config tweaks), **remove them and reproduce the issue on an official sunnypilot branch** before reporting. This rules out your modifications as the cause and helps maintainers focus on real bugs.

1. **Upgrade** to the latest version — the bug may already be fixed
2. **Remove customizations** — reproduce on a stock official branch
3. **Search** [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/sunnypilot/sunnypilot/issues) and the [sunnypilot community forum](https://community.sunnypilot.ai) for known reports
4. **Preserve the route** — upload raw logs via [Comma Connect](https://connect.comma.ai) and keep the route available

## What to Include

### Required Information

- **Dongle ID** — Your comma Dongle ID (found in **Settings** → **Device** or in Comma Connect)
- **Route ID** — The route ID from Comma Connect for the drive where the issue occurred
- **Device info** — Hardware model (C3, C3X, C4), software version, branch
- **Vehicle info** — Make, model, year
